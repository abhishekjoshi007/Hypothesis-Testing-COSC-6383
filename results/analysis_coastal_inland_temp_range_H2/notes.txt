Here’s a clear explanation of how your “Coastal vs Inland Temperature Range” hypothesis has been proved and what kind of counter-questions (or challenges) can reasonably be raised about your result.

✅ Hypothesis Recap

Statement:

Coastal cities have smaller annual temperature ranges than inland cities.

Meaning:
We expect coastal locations (closer to oceans) to have a more stable temperature throughout the year due to oceanic moderation, whereas inland locations experience larger temperature swings between summer and winter.

🔍 How it was Tested

Data Sources

You used monthly temperature data (2000–2024) for:

Coastal: San Francisco, Corpus Christi, Mumbai

Inland: Chicago, Columbus, New Delhi

Reference: New York (borderline case)

Each city’s annual temperature range = (max monthly temperature − min monthly temperature) for each year.

Statistical Test

Checked normality (Shapiro-Wilk) and variance equality (Levene).

Since the distributions were non-normal → Mann–Whitney U test was used.

Result:
p ≈ 0.0000 → extremely significant.
Mean annual range:

Coastal ≈ 13 °C

Inland ≈ 24 °C
→ Inland cities show roughly double the seasonal swing.

Effect Size

Cliff’s Delta ≈ −0.9, a very large effect magnitude confirming practical as well as statistical difference.

Visualization

Box-and-swarm plot clearly shows inland distributions shifted upward.

The added New York panel sits visually between coastal and inland means, supporting its “mixed” climate classification.

🧭 Conclusion

The hypothesis is supported (strongly proved).
Coastal cities indeed show smaller annual temperature ranges than inland cities, both statistically and visually.

The result aligns with physical reasoning: ocean proximity moderates temperature by absorbing heat in summer and releasing it in winter.

❓ Potential Counter-Questions / Challenges

Sample Bias / Representativeness

Only 3 coastal and 3 inland cities were used.
→ Are they globally representative? Would adding more coastal cities (e.g., Sydney, Tokyo, Lisbon) change the outcome?

Geographical Confounders

Latitude affects temperature range as strongly as distance from coast.
→ Did you control for latitude or altitude differences?

Temporal Coverage

The period 2000–2024 includes warming trends.
→ Could long-term climate change or urban heat effects distort “range” rather than pure location effect?

Metric Choice

Using “max − min monthly mean” captures only extremes.
→ Would using standard deviation or daily averages give a different picture of variability?

Data Consistency

Different data sources (point vs. grid) may have varying spatial resolution.
→ Are inland and coastal datasets equally precise?

🧩 How to Strengthen It Further

If you want to refine this hypothesis for your report or presentation:

Add more coastal and inland pairs on multiple continents.

Include latitude as a covariate in a regression model.

Test robustness using bootstrapped confidence intervals or two-way ANOVA (Type × Latitude).
